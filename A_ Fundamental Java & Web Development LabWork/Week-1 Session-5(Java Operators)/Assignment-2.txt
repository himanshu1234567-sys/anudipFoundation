Assignment-2. Write a Java program that allows the user to create a bank account andperform transactions such as deposit, withdrawal, and balance inquiry. Using a conditional operator (ternary operator ), display the message whether minimumbalanceis maintained or not. Steps: 
● Create a class BankAccount 
● Add three member variables: String accountHolderName , int accountNumber and int balance; 
● Add a constructors using all three members 
● Add getters and setters. 
● Add method deposit (int), withdraw(int) 
● Implement the methods by increasing or decreasing the balance 
● In the main method create a bank account 
● Withdraw money from this account and/or deposit into this account 
● Get the balance 
● Create a string variable “status” inside the main method 
● Assign values to status as “Minimum Balance Maintained” if balance is aboveor equal to 5000. Otherwise values of status will be “Minimum Balance not Maintained”. Use conditional operator (ternary operator ) to assign the valuesof the status. 
● Display the status.


class BankAccount {
    private String accountHolderName;
    private int accountNumber;
    private int balance;

    public BankAccount(String accountHolderName, int accountNumber, int balance) {
        this.accountHolderName = accountHolderName;
        this.accountNumber = accountNumber;
        this.balance = balance;
    }

    public void deposit(int amount) {
        balance += amount;
    }

    public void withdraw(int amount) {
        balance = (balance >= amount) ? balance - amount : balance;
    }

    public int getBalance() {
        return balance;
    }

    public String getStatus() {
        return (balance >= 5000) ? "Minimum Balance Maintained" : "Minimum Balance not Maintained";
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        BankAccount account = new BankAccount("John Doe", 123456, 6000);

        account.withdraw(2000);
        account.deposit(1000);

        System.out.println("Current Balance: $" + account.getBalance());

        String status = account.getStatus();
        System.out.println("Status: " + status);
    }
}
