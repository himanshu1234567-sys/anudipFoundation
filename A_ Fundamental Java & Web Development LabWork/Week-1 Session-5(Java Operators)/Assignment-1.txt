Assignment-1. Write a Java program that uses a method to calculate the area of a rectangle andcompare them using Relational Operator Steps: ● Create a class Rectangle.
● The Rectangle class should have two attributes length and width of type int. 
● Create a constructor that accepts length and width as parameters. 
● Area should be calculated as length*area. 
● Instantiate two Rectangle classes with random values. 
● Compare the areas of the two rectangles using the Relational Operator. 
● If the first one is bigger than the second one, print “Rectangle1 > Rectangle2”. ● If the first one is smaller print “Rectangle1 < Rectangle2”. 
● Otherwise print “They are equal”. 


class Rectangle {
    private int length;
    private int width;

    public Rectangle(int length, int width) {
        this.length = length;
        this.width = width;
    }

    public int calculateArea() {
        return length * width;
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Rectangle rectangle1 = new Rectangle(5, 10);
        Rectangle rectangle2 = new Rectangle(8, 6);

        int area1 = rectangle1.calculateArea();
        int area2 = rectangle2.calculateArea();

        if (area1 > area2) {
            System.out.println("Rectangle1 > Rectangle2");
        } else if (area1 < area2) {
            System.out.println("Rectangle1 < Rectangle2");
        } else {
            System.out.println("They are equal");
        }
    }
}
