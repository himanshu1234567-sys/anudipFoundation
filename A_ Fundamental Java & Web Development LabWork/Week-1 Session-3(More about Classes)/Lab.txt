● Write a Java program named Car 
● The Car class should have the following attributes: make (String), model (String) , year (short) , and price(int) . 
● The car class should have a constructor that takes all the attributes. 
● Add a main method to instantiate car objects.
● The program should allow the user to create and display objects of each Car Class.

public class Car {

	String make;
	String model;
	short year;
	int price;
	
	public Car(String make, String model, short year, int price) {
		super();
		this.make = make;
		this.model = model;
		this.year = year;
		this.price = price;
	}
	
	public void display() {
        System.out.println("Make: " + make);
        System.out.println("Model: " + model);
        System.out.println("Year: " + year);
        System.out.println("Price: $" + price);
        System.out.println();
    }

	
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		
		Car car1 = new Car("Toyota", "Camry", (short) 2020, 25000);
        Car car2 = new Car("Honda", "Accord", (short) 2021, 28000);

        
        System.out.println("Details of Car 1:");
        car1.display();

        System.out.println("Details of Car 2:");
        car2.display();
	}
	
}
