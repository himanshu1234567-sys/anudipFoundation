1.    What are the benefits of using Java programming language?
      High level language
      


2.    Why is Java known as a platform independent language?
Ans.  Platform Independent means that the java compiled code (byte code) can run on all OS. A program is written
      in a language that is human readable language. It may contain word, phrases etc, which the machine does not 
      understand, for the source code to be understand by the machine it need to be in language understand by the 
      machine, typically a machine-level language, so here comes the role of compiler. The compiler convert the high-
      level language into a format understand by the machines, therefore a compiler is a program that translate the
      source code for another program from a programming language into executable code. 
       
      so, Java has JVM for these operation JVM does these all work so, we can simply say Java is a platform independent 
      language because it has JVM 


3.    What is the main() method in Java, explain its signature in detail.
Ans.  In Java, the main() method is a special method , it is the starting point for a Java application. when we run the 
      java program firstly compiler search for the main method, java program starts execution from the main method.
      
      It has some signatures are:
      public -  Accsess modifier which shows that main method can be access from anywhere
      static -
      void   -  It is the return type which indicating that it doesn't return any value
      main   -  It is the name of the method
      string[args] -  args parameter is an array of strings


4.    Write a Java program to print the addition of two numbers.
Ans.  package assignment_2;

      public class Addition {
	
           public static void main(String[] args) {
    	
    	   int a = 15;
    	   int b = 82;
    	   int sum = a+b;
	
           System.out.println("The sum of all are : " + sum);
	}

     }


5.    Write a Java program to calculate the factorial of a number.
Ans.  package assignment_2;

      public class Factorial{  
	 
             public static void main(String args[]){  
		  
		  int i, factorial=1;  
		  int number=5; 
		  
		  for(i=1; i<=number; i++){    
			  factorial = factorial*i;    
		  }    
		  
		  System.out.println("Factorial of "+number+" is: "+ factorial);    
		 
	      }  
         } 



PRIME FACTORIAL
The prime factors of a number are all of the integers below that number that are
divisible into the number as well as 1. For example, the prime factors of 12 are 1,2,3,4,6, and 12.



do the Dry run of these  codes 

public class FibonacciSeries {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int n = 10; // Change this value to adjust the number of terms

        int a = 0, b = 1;
        System.out.print("Fibonacci Series: ");

        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            System.out.print(a + " ");
            int sum = a + b;
            a = b;
            b = sum;
        }
    }
}




public class PrimeNumbers {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int n = 50; // Change this value to adjust the range

        System.out.println("Prime Numbers from 1 to " + n + ":");
        for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
            boolean isPrime = true;

            for (int j = 2; j < i; j++) {
                if (i % j == 0) {
                    isPrime = false;
                    break;
                }
            }

            if (isPrime) {
                System.out.print(i + " ");
            }
        }
    }
}
